            <li> All games must be Wagered on</li>
            <br>
            <p> Having the game mean something allows for players to always put in maximum effort, allowing us to get smarter 
                grow as people (also winning money is fun). Wagering is done in two ways, You have a win reward and a loss punishment.
                Pick what you want if you or your team wins (the defualt is $5 from all players), And pick what you will do if you lose 
                such as household chores (dishes, mopping ect..).
                <br>
                You can ask for whatever you want but if your demand is too great and your punishment doesnt match then the group can vote
                to have you change your wagers. If a wager cannot be agreed upon within two rounds of voting the win will be defualted.
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <li> Games will be voted on at the beggining of the night</li>
            <br>
            <p> You are welcome to bring whatever game you want so long as all players can play it
            <br>
            if a game is new to a player 1hr will be alloted to learn the mechanics before game night begins.

            <li>After the game</li>
            <p> If and only if all players agree, a new game may be played with a new set of wagers
                <br>
            otherwise, See you next week! </p>
            
            <li>Nothing is personal</li>
            <br>
            <p> This is game, and all players should respect eachother. Expect to go into this experience and lose $5, that is the Cost
                of admission to have a night of fun, in exchange you might win well more than you bet.
